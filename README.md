# Operation IronSwords

# 🇮🇱 Community Aid Ticketing and Inventory Management System 🇮🇱

## English:

In light of the on-going war, IronSwords, we are developing a system to provide pivotal support to our communities during such critical times. This open-source project is aimed at creating a web application to facilitate logistics among hotels/locations, volunteers, and warehouses within a city. Each hotel or location operates a ticketing system where operators can create, manage, and resolve tickets regarding aid requests or information dissemination. Furthermore, the system manages inventory across different warehouses, categorizing items like clothing, hygiene products, food, and children's games. By enhancing communication and aid distribution, this initiative ensures prompt and effective assistance to those in need during turbulent times. Your contributions and support towards this cause are highly appreciated.
